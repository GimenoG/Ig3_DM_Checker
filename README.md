DM Checker
The objective of the DM Checker application is to simplify and accelerate the work of project evaluation made 
by student groups. The idea is to automate part of the assessment so that students will not be assessed on "nonsense": 
a file is missing, does not compile not building the executable requested is unnecessary views but on actual
software quality: functional goals are there, the code quality is proven, etc..

The project consists of three parts.
1) Sudden Death party testing formal properties must verify the deliverable (an archive), project type is not specified here.
2) The test section will apply junit tests in the project is a Java project,
3) The party evaluation that allows for functional testing of a software project and read the material and take notes / comments and give a rating by several criteria.
